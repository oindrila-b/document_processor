# Documento [Client Side]

## What is Documento?

Documento is a Fullstack application built using React JS and Python. 
This repository contains the backend, i.e, the Server Side of the application. Documento allows the user to make a summary out of their document or get answer to questions regarding their document. Documento uses two NLP models to process the Document.
The first model is :
1. [The Bart Large CNN model by Facebook](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn) - This model was used to process the data or content sent to the backend server and create a summary out of the context.
2. [Deepset's Roberta Base Squad2](https://huggingface.co/deepset/roberta-base-squad2) - This model was used to process the data or content sent to the backend server and answer questions regarding the context sent to it.
