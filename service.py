Principal Accounting Policies continuedForeign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are accounted for at the exchange rates ruling at the transaction dates.Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition of a foreign entity after 1st January 2003 are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated into United States dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end.103Notes to the Financial Statements36. Principal Accounting Policies continuedTangible assets and depreciation Freehold properties comprised land and buildings. Freehold land is stated at cost less any impairment. No depreciation is provided on freehold land as it is deemed to have an indefinite life. Buildings on freehold and leasehold land are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment. Other tangible assets are stated at cost less amounts provided for depreciation and impairment.Depreciation of tangible assets is calculated on the straight-line basis to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life. The residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date. The estimated useful lives are as follows:The profit or loss on disposal of tangible assets is recognised by reference to their carrying amounts.Freehold buildingsBuildings on leasehold landLeasehold improvementsPlant and machinery10425 to 40 yearsShorter of the lease term or useful lifeShorter of unexpired lease term or useful life3 to 15 years3 to 7 yearsDairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 202036.

Principal Accounting Policies continuedInvestments The Group’s investments are measured at fair value through profit and loss. The classification is based on the management’s business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics.Equity investments are measured at fair value with fair value gains and losses recognised in profit and loss. Transaction costs of investments carried at fair value through profit and loss are expensed in profit and loss.106Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 202036. Principal Accounting Policies continuedThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit and loss.The Group’s total contributions relating to the defined contribution plans are charged to profit and loss in the year to which they relate.107Chairman’s StatementFood – ConvenienceHealth and BeautyHome Furnishings8 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020AssociatesDairy Farm is accelerating the pace of its digital change to adapt to the rapidly changing environment.The launch of Yuu Rewards in July 2020 represented a critical milestone in driving Dairy Farm’s modernisation and digital transformation.

Principal Accounting Policies continued108Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020The fair value of derivatives which are designated and qualified as effective hedges are classified as non-current assets or liabilities if the remaining maturities of the hedged assets or liabilities are greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.109Notes to the Financial Statements36. Principal Accounting Policies continuedDividends Dividends proposed or declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.The key types of buying income which the Group receives include:– Discounts and incentives relate to individual unit sales. – Sales volume-based incentives based on achieving certain purchases on promotion for an event or a period. – Conditional incentives subject to satisfaction of certain conditions by the Group. – Fixed amounts agreed with suppliers for supporting in-store activity.Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the profit and loss as other income on a systematic basis in the period in which the expenses are recognised. Unconditional grants are recognised in the profit and loss as other income when they become receivable.Grants related to assets are deducted in arriving at the carrying value of the related assets.110Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 202036. Principal Accounting Policies continuedRent concessions received as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic are recognised in the profit and loss over the period in which they cover when the specific conditions are met.Pre-operating costs Pre-operating costs are expensed as incurred.37. Standards and Amendments Issued But Not Yet EffectiveA number of amendments effective for accounting periods beginning after 2020 have been published and will be adopted by the Group from their effective dates. The Group is currently assessing the potential impact of these standard and amendments but expects the adoption will not have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements. The more important amendments are set out below.111Notes to the Financial Statements38. Financial Risk ManagementHedge ineffectiveness for interest rate swaps is assessed using the same principles as for hedges of foreign currency purchases. It may occur due to:(i) The credit value/debit value adjustment on the interest rate swaps which is not matched by the loan;(ii) Differences in critical terms between the interest rate swaps and loans; andThe ineffectiveness during 2020 in relation to interest rate swaps was not material while there was no interest rate swap in 2019.112Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 202038. Financial Risk Management continuedThe Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options in a consistent manner to hedge firm and anticipated foreign exchange commitments and manage foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions. The purpose of these hedges is to mitigate the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on assets and liabilities and the profit and loss account of the Group.Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of monetary assets and liabilities being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency. There are no significant monetary balances held by Group companies at 31st December 2020 that are denominated in a non-functional currency. Differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Group’s presentation currency are not taken into consideration.Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will impact cash flows arising from variable rate financial instruments. Borrowings at floating rates therefore expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group manages this risk by entering into interest rate swaps for a maturity of up to three years. Interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rate to fixed rate. Details of interest rate swaps are set out in note 30.113Notes to the Financial Statements(ii) Credit risk The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to deposits with banks and derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value. The Group has credit policies in place and the exposures to these credit risks are monitored on an ongoing basis.Sales to customers are made in cash or by major credit cards. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet after deducting any impairment allowance.114Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 202038.

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value measured by observable current market transactions.The fair values of long-term borrowings are based on market prices or are estimated using the expected future payments discounted at market interest rates.

Critical Accounting Estimates and JudgementsPension obligations The present value of the pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost/income for pensions include the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations.120Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 202039.
